# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Project 0 of the HarvardX CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript online course. 

I created a website with 4 pages as detailed below:
Picture Page: The first page with a picture and some CSS applied to it
Lists Page: Contains an ordered list and an unordered list
Table Page: Contains a table with an @media applied to it via CSS
Paragraph Page: contains a simple paragraph.

All the pages contain the code required to meet the specifications of the Project 0 assignment.
